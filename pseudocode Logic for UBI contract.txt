Logic for UBI contract

ERC20 Beans
ERC721 BeanX




!!!!!!!!!!!!!! use safemath for all math !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!! see https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/common-patterns.html for details on send vs withdraw ... we will have to implement the withdraw pattern instead of send.

                }
