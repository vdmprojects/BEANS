Logic for UBI contract

ERC20 Beans
ERC721 BeanX
//!!!!!!!! owned
//this contract needs to be owned, and interfaces to BEANS and BEANX contracts referenced to address
//we need to implement messaging 

address beansAddress = xxxxxx;
address beanxAddress = xxxxxx;

//!!!!!make functions to set beans / beanx adresses using owned (onlyOwner?)


!!!!!!!!!!!!!! use safemath for all math !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!! see https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/common-patterns.html for details on send vs withdraw ... we will have to implement the withdraw pattern instead of send.

 import "./Safemath.sol";

                }
